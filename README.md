# Power BI Dashboard Creation - Data Visualization Course

-> In this project, I created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to showcase key performance indexes (KPIs) from the dataset. 


-> The dashboard integrates various data visualization techniques, such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and tables, to present data in an intuitive and interactive format.


-> It allows users to filter and drill down into specific data points for deeper analysis.


->The dashboard was designed with clarity and usability in mind, ensuring that it effectively communicates trends, patterns, and key metrics, making it an invaluable tool for decision-making.
